Claude-code projects to go into this /c folder.
1. Each project should create its own sub-directory.
2. There could be a folder for common assets here at /c/assets/
3. There should be an index.html in this folder that maintains a nice looking html page that includes links and brief description to each project. Include a small screen-shot of each project. There should be a compact list view option and large card view display of the projects.
4. Additional notes can be added to this file as needed.
