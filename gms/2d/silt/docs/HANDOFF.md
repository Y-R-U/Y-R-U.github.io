# SILT — handoff log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom.

## P0+P1 (manager)
Sim core, bot, oracle, boot gate, main.js integration seam all landed and green.
Key finding is D3 in DECISIONS.md: the clear mechanic only works at 3 tints with
mono-coloured pieces, and that is percolation maths rather than tuning.

## Checkpoint 1 (manager)
Committed and pushed as 5e4a625. Deliberately NOT in projects.js yet — the card
screenshot is the game's first impression and must come from the real renderer.

## Lane E audio — done
Six procedural Web Audio cues (land/chain/dissolve/rotate/drop/fail) built from
noise grains, pitch-glided blips and resonant sweeps through a shared generated
reverb. Magnitude is real, not just volume: a 2000-cell chain measurably
outweighs a 200-cell one.

Four SUNO beds (dune/abyss/kiln/zen), cut into seamless loops by crossfading each
segment's head onto its own tail, loudness-matched to -20 LUFS so biomes do not
jump. Compressed mono 64kbps/32kHz: 14.57 MB -> 1.72 MB (12.4%).

Two gotchas recorded by that lane, worth keeping:
- Headless Chrome has no output device, so a real-time AudioContext advances
  ~5 ms then suspends. The engine takes an injected context so it can be verified
  through an OfflineAudioContext instead.
- The visibility handler ramps master to 0 on document.hidden. If a mode ever
  wants audio to continue backgrounded, that is the line to change.

## Cloud save (manager)
js/cloud.js wired to /lib/auth/localsync.js over silt.best / silt.settings /
silt.stats only — never board state. canPester is false while playing, so the
sign-in nudge only appears on attract, menus and results, and it is a callout
pill rather than a modal.
